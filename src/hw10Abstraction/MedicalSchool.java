	/* Question ii)
	 * You have 3 abstract class names --MedicalSchool, EngineeringSchool, and
	 * NursingSchool. how many keywords are used for the inheritance in Java for
	 * Abstract Class? Can an Abstract Class inherit other Abstract Class or a
	 * regular class or interface by extends or implements keyword? How many
	 * inheritances is possible by an Abstract Class? Use one of above Abstract
	 * Class (MedicalSchool extends NursingSchool implements LawSchool) and use the
	 * keywords to answer my questions
	 */
//Ans:Abstract class can inherit using two keywords - extends and implements
//	extends is used to inherit a class and implement is used to inherit an interface
//	An abstract class can inherit an abstract class or regular class using extends keyword
//	An abstract class can inherit an interface(s) using implement keyword
//	An abstract class can inherit only one class but can inherit more than one interfaces
